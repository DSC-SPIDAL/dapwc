The type of communications
--
1. Allreduce <int[]>; RunnningPWC.NCent
   Allreduce <double[]>; 1000 (NumberofBins in FindCenters)
                         RunningPWC.NCent
2. Allreduce <MPIReducePlusIndex<int, double>>; reduce operations are min
with idx or max with idx

3. Broadcast <int[]>; pointCountGlobal
   Boradcast <double[]>; MaxNCent (from config)

4. SendReceive <double[]>; PointCountLargest (for a proc) * localNCent (or
less if some clusters are not used)

5. SendReceive <MPISecPacket<double[], double[]>>;
RunningPWC.NCent*PointCountLargest (for each array)

6. SendReceive <MPIPacket<double[]>>; RunningPWC.NCent*PointCountLargest

7. Send <MPIPacket<int[]>>; pointCount_proc
   Receive <MPIPacket<int[]>>; pointCount_proc
