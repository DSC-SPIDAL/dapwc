Deterministic Annealing Pairwise Clustering

Prerequisites
-----
1. Operating System
  * This program is extensively tested and known to work on,
    *  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.10 (Tikanga)
    *  Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS
    *  Ubuntu 12.10
  * This may work in Windows systems depending on the ability to setup OpenMPI properly, however, this has not been tested and we recommend choosing a Linux based operating system instead.
 
2. Java 1.8
  * Download Oracle JDK 8 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  * Extract the archive to a folder named jdk1.8.0
  * Set the following environment variables
  ```
    JAVA_HOME=path-to-jdk1.8.0-directory
  ```

We like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Vivek Sarkar 
and his team at Rice University for giving us access and 
continuous support for HJ library. We are equally thankful to Prof. Guillermo López Taboada for giving us free unrestricted access to commercially available FastMPJ MPI library, which we evaluated in an earlier internal version. We are also 
thankful to FutureGrid project and its support team for their 
support with HPC systems
